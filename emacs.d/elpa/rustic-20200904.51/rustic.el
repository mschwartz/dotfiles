;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a fork of rust-mode.
;;
;; Differences with rust-mode:
;;
;; - rust-analyzer configuration
;; - flycheck integration
;; - cargo popup
;; - multiline error parsing
;; - translation of ANSI control sequences through xterm-color
;; - async org babel
;; - custom compilation process
;; - rustfmt errors in a rust compilation mode
;; - automatic RLS configuration with eglot or lsp-mode
;; - cask for testing
;; - requires emacs 26
;; - etc.
