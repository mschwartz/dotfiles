But instead of the normal GUI tabs you might think of,
it provides a more keyboard-oriented (and visually inadequate) tabs.
You can jump to a specific buffer by `nerdtab-jump-<number>'
or by clicking the tab.

`nerdtab-mode' is a global minor mode.
Turn it on and it will open a side window and display buffers as tabs for you.

Checkout homepage for more information on usage and customizations.

Note that `nerdtab--' means private, `nerdtab-' means public / customizable (for variables)
