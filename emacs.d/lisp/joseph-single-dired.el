;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  In Dired, when you choose a directory to visit,
;;  it is normally visited in a new buffer – the
;;  Dired buffer you chose it in is not deleted.
;;  Some people don’t like this behavior, because as you
;;  navigate around the directory tree you accumulate
;;  Dired buffers, one for each directory you visit.
;;
;;  So ,`joseph-single-dired.el' can make you just open
;;  a single dired buffer.
;;  I bind `dired-mouse-find-alternate-file' on [mouse-2]
;;  so even you click on a directory in dired buffer ,
;;  it will reuse current dired buffer too.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  Just put `joseph-single-dired.el' to your load-path.
;;  The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;;  It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;;  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;;  Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;;  (eval-after-load 'dired '(progn (require 'joseph-single-dired)))
;;
;;  No need more.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `dired-mouse-find-alternate-file'
;;    In dired, visit the file or directory you click on instead of the dired buffer.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
